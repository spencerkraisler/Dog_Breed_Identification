# Dog_Breed_Identification
I made a convolution neural network that can identify the dog breed from a .jpg photo. This is my submission for this Kaggle competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification

To train network:
1) Download repository
2) Download data from here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/data. There are over 10000 dog images in the Doggo folder, so downloading will take some time
3) Rename folder "Doggo"
4) Place it in the same folder as DoggoConv.py
5) Run DoggoConv.py
