# Dog_Breed_Identification
I made a convolution neural network that can identify the dog breed from a .jpg photo. This is my submission for this Kaggle competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification

To train network, download repository and run DoggoConv.py. There are over 10000 dog images in the Doggo folder, so downloading will take some time.
